Who won the election

Your Task:
- Return the name of the winner.
- If there is no winner, return None

A name is an arbitrary string, e.g. "A", "B", or "XJDHD".
The ballot-box is represented by an unsorted list of names. 
Each entry in the list corresponds to one vote for this name. 
A name wins the election if it gets more than n/2 votes (n = number of all votes)
