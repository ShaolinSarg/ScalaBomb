# ScalaBomb
All of the questions and answers for our scala bomb game

## Rules of the game

1. The mad scala bomber decides on a duration for the round (2-3 days)
2. The bomber sets a player a problem to solve (max 30 mins concentrated effort to solve) and the timer starts
3. The player answers the question and submits a pull request for their solution
4. If the bomber is happy with the solution, the player then sets another question for a different player
5. This continues until the timer runs out and the bomb goes off.
6. The player that got bombed performs a small forefit and becomes the mad bomber in the next round
